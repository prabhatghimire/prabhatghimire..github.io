# Prabhat Ghimire · Resume (Static Site)

A minimal, fast static webpage for hosting your resume on GitHub Pages.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` in any browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository named `resume` (or any name).
2. Commit these files and push to GitHub:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `README.md`
3. In the repository, go to Settings → Pages.
4. Under "Build and deployment", choose:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`
5. Save. Your site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Print / PDF

Use the browser's Print dialog to export to PDF. The page includes print-optimized styles (hides footer, removes colors/links styling).

## Edit your info

All content is in `index.html`. Update links in the header contact section as needed.
